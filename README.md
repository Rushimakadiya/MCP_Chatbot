# 🚀 MyClient: Intelligent Chat & Tool Orchestration

## Overview
**MyClient** is a powerful Python application that bridges users, tools, and language models (LLMs) through a seamless chat interface. Designed for flexibility and extensibility, MyClient manages server connections, executes tools, and processes user queries—all in one place.

### ✨ Key Features
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support:** Effortlessly manage context and state between user, tools, and LLMs for advanced conversational workflows.
- **Modular Tool Integration:** Easily add or update tools for custom tasks.
- **LLM Connectivity:** Interact with your favorite language models for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Persistent Chat Sessions:** Maintain context and history for richer conversations.
- **Configurable & Secure:** Environment-based configuration and secure handling of sensitive data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd myclient_project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your environment variables (API keys, server URLs, etc.).

### Usage

Start the application with:
```
python src/main.py
```
Follow the interactive prompts in your terminal to chat, run tools, and leverage LLM capabilities.

## 🧩 How MCP (Model Context Protocol) Works

MCP enables advanced context management between the user, tools, and LLMs. This allows:
- **Stateful Conversations:** Maintain context across multiple turns.
- **Tool-LLM Collaboration:** Tools can provide intermediate results to the LLM, which can then generate more informed responses.
- **Custom Workflows:** Easily extend or modify the protocol for your own use cases.

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- **Automated Data Analysis:** Ask questions and trigger analysis tools, with results summarized by the LLM.
- **Conversational Agents:** Build chatbots that can access external tools and maintain rich context.
- **Research Assistants:** Integrate with search, summarization, and data extraction tools.
